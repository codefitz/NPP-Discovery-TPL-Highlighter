npp-tpl
=======

.tpl extension syntax highlighting and blocking functionality. These couple of 
files will let you load .tpl files with automatic syntax highlighting in 
notepad++, including creating documentation blocks. More to come: autocomplete.
Heavily based on the html language, very much a work in progress.

Installation(from [this site](https://communities.bmc.com/communities/docs/DOC-20540/version/1)):

1. Copy the tpl.xml file into <Notepad++_install_directory>\plugins\APIs
1. Go to c:\Documents and Settings\<your_username>\Application Data\Notepad++ OR C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++
1. If there is an existing userDefineLang.xml present, take a backup
1. Copy the new userDefineLang.xml to that location
1. Close all existing files in Notepad++ and restart it.
1. TPL should be available in the language list, and files saved as .tpl should use it automatically
